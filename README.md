# Crabby Patti vs The World!!

Crabby Patti is a character I saw on an artist's instagram page (https://www.instagram.com/van____van) and I thought she was perfect for a videogame. Back then I was learning how to make videogames and I read it is good to make a clone of an existing videogame just to understand the ropes. So I did! I made a little clone of this old Mario arcade game where you needed to flip and kick enemies to earn points and advance. 

I did a basic version, art and all, but I wasn't satisfied! So I picked up the project back again, added items, new cool enemies, and improved the visuals. Great results! It was taking shape. 

Now I aim to separate it from its clone status by adding a new mechanic to advance between the levels, and also bosses! So keep an eye out ; )

## About this version

Patti_slice means it is a vertical slice, this is, I aim to make one level only including all the basic mechanics!

## Stack and specifications

I made Patti it in Unity 2022, writing on C# and using Aseprite to create all sprites and animations
